Description: GStreamer plugins from the "rawparse" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
 to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

 This package contains unstripped shared libraries. It is provided primarily
 to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat
 easier to interpret core dumps. The libraries are installed in
 /usr/lib/debug and are automatically used by gdb.
